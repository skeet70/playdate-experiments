# Assets Rules
# doc: https://github.com/boozook/playdate/blob/main/support/build/README.md#assets
# [package.metadata.playdate.assets]
# "img/system/" = "${PLAYDATE_SDK_PATH}/Examples/Game Template/Source/SystemAssets/*.png"
# "sfx/jump.wav" = "${PLAYDATE_SDK_PATH}/Examples/Level 1-1/Source/sfx/jump.wav"
# This is a complex way of specifying what assets should be included.
# Left hand is a path where asset should be in the package,
# Right hand is the path where source(s) should be found.

# Also this way supports simple include and exclude instructions:
# "rel-to-crate-root/file-to-include" = true   # left hand is a local path, relative to crate-root,
# "file-to-exclude" = false  # OR resulting path that where asset will be in the resulting package.

# Another way to declare assets is much simpler:
# [package.metadata.playdate]
# assets = ["assets/**/*.wav", "assets/**/*.png"]
# That means "just include all of this".
